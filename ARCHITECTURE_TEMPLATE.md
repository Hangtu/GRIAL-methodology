> **SYSTEM INSTRUCTION FOR AI:** > Before writing any code, you MUST read this file.
> If a user request violates the **Restrictions (R)** or compromises the **Architecture (A)**, you must REJECT the request and explain why.

## 1. G - GROUNDING (The North Star)

This application exists EXCLUSIVELY to enable **[TARGET USER]** to **[CORE ACTION]** in order to eliminate **[MAJOR PAIN POINT]**.

_Any code or feature that does not directly facilitate this sentence is considered Waste._

## 2. R - RESTRICTIONS (The Anti-Roadmap)

The following features are EXPLICITLY BANNED from the current version (MVP). Do not generate code for:

1. [Banned Feature 1]
2. [Banned Feature 2]
3. [Banned Feature 3]

## 3. I - ITINERARY (The Happy Path)

The implementation must follow this strict linear flow. Do not deviate for edge cases yet.

1. **Screen A:** [Description]
2. **Screen B:** [Description]
3. **Screen C:** [Description]
   --> **GOAL/CONVERSION**

## 4. A - ARCHITECTURE (The God Entity)

The central source of truth for the database is the **[ENTITY NAME]** table.
The following fields are IMMUTABLE and MANDATORY:

- `id` (UUID/Int)
- `[Critical Field 1]`
- `[Critical Field 2]`
- `[Status Field]`

## 5. L - LAUNCH CRITERIA (Definition of Done)

Development ceases and deployment begins immediately when:

> _[Exact verifiable condition, e.g., "A user can process a $1 payment via Stripe in Production environment."]_
